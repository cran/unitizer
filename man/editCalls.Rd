\usage{
editCalls(x, lang.old, lang.new, ...)

\S4method{editCalls}{unitizer,language,language}(x, lang.old, lang.new, interactive.only = TRUE, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{a unitizer object}

\item{lang.old}{the name of the function replace}

\item{lang.new}{the new name of the function}

\item{...}{unused}

\item{interactive.only}{logical(1L) set to FALSE if you want to allow this to
run in non-interactive mode, but warnings will be suppressed and will
proceed without prompting, obviously...}
}
\value{
a untizer object with function names modifies
}
\description{
Used if you want to change language in test expression in a unitizer when
the actual results of running the expressions is unchanged.  This is useful
if you decided to rename functions, etc., without having to re-run the entire
\code{unitize} process since \code{unitize} matches tests based on
expressions.
}
\note{
this is a somewhat experimental function, so make sure you backup any
  unitizers before you try to use it.
